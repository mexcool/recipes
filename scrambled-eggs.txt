Ingredients
2 large free range eggs
6tbsp single cream or full cream milk
a knob of butter

Method

Lightly whisk the eggs, cream and a pinch of salt together until all the ingredients are just combined and the mixture has one consistency.

Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add the butter and let it melt. Don’t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs. Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan. Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.

Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places, then remove from the heat and leave for a few seconds to finish cooking. Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.
